|**namespaceName** | **String** | The namespace name of this snapshot. |  [optional] |
|**isReplica** | **Boolean** | Is this a replicated object. |  [optional] |
|**consistency** | [**ConsistencyEnum**](#ConsistencyEnum) | Indicates what type of recovery strategies must be invoked when provisioning from this snapshot. |  [optional] |
|**missingNonLoggedData** | **Boolean** | Indicates if a virtual database provisioned from this snapshot will be missing nologging changes. |  [optional] |
|**datasetId** | **String** | The ID of the Snapshot&#39;s dSource or VDB. |  [optional] |
|**creationTime** | **OffsetDateTime** | The time when the snapshot was created. |  [optional] |
|**startTimestamp** | **OffsetDateTime** | The timestamp within the parent TimeFlow at which this snapshot was initiated. \\ No recovery earlier than this point needs to be applied in order to provision a database from \\ this snapshot. If start_timestamp equals timestamp, then no recovery needs to be \\ applied in order to provision a database.  |  [optional] |
|**startLocation** | **String** | The database specific indentifier within the parent TimeFlow at which this snapshot was initiated. \\ No recovery earlier than this point needs to be applied in order to provision a database from \\ this snapshot.

|**retention** | **Long** | Retention policy, in days. A value of -1 indicates the snapshot should be kept forever. Deprecated in favor of expiration and retain_forever. |  [optional] |
|**expiration** | **LocalDate** | The expiration date of this snapshot. If this is unset and retain_forever is false, and the snapshot is not included in a Bookmark, the snapshot is subject to the retention policy of its dataset. |  [optional] |
|**retainForever** | **Boolean** | Indicates that the snapshot is protected from retention, i.e it will be kept forever. If false, see expiration. |  [optional] |
|**effectiveExpiration** | **LocalDate** | The effective expiration is that max of the snapshot expiration and the expiration of any Bookmark which includes this snapshot. |  [optional] |
|**effectiveRetainForever** | **Boolean** | True if retain_forever is set or a Bookmark retains this snapshot forever. |  [optional] |

|**mssqlInternalVersion** | **Integer** | Internal version of the source database at the time the snapshot was taken. |  [optional] |

|**mssqlBackupLocationType** | [**MssqlBackupLocationTypeEnum**](#MssqlBackupLocationTypeEnum) | Backup software used to restore the source database backup for this snapshot |  [optional] |
|**mssqlEmptySnapshot** | **Boolean** | True if the staging push dSource snapshot is empty. |  [optional] |
|**oracleFromPhysicalStandbyVdb** | **Boolean** | True if this snapshot was taken of a standby database. |  [optional] |
|**oracleRedoLogSizeInBytes** | **Long** | Online redo log size in bytes when this snapshot was taken. |  [optional] |
